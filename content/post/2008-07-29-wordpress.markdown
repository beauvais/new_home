](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/2596595550_50d53740c8_m.jpg)Some of my long-term readers (hi, Mum) might remember that my original blog was a Drupal install, and that my less-than-lovely ISP dropped my connection as I was uploading some new filesâ€”therefore borking the CSS. If you don't follow, that's OK. The point is that my old site was Drupal (a heavy-duty Content Management System, which is fantastic) now it's Wordperss (cause it does blogging, and does it well). Well, WordPress has won my geeky heart (it's smaller than my cynical heart, and not as strong as my music heart, but probably the most covered here).

They have done one thing in the past month which has really, really impressed me. They've got a plugin which lets you upgrade to the latest version of their software (which you install on your webserver yourself) without any complicated, difficult-to-remember steps. This is why I lost Drupal: upgrading, and it killing itself in the transfer. Now, I have the latest WordPress, and I'm very impressed.

Its WYSIWYG editor works better, and the media manager is fantastic. As you probably know, I stopped using a local blogging client because ecto is rubbish, and Vista is worse. So I now blog from WordPress itself through Firefox on my Mac. Three things that make me happy: Wordpress on Firefox running on a Mac... ah!

Another thing which is brilliant is the flickr sidebar plugin I have had for ages. I completely forgot to check out its "[view more photos](http://www.zachbeauvais.com/flickr)" link. It automatically finds images from the sets I've told it about, and uses them to create a page on my site populated with my flickr stream images!

On a down side, I've just noticed that it's impossible to see the bottom of the sidebar if Twitter is down, because I have my tweets (micro-blog messages) being pulled into a widget above it, so if it's down, it doesn't load the rest of the sidebar. I think that's something Wordpress should sort out. Oh, well. I'm just going to switch my images tab over to flickr.
