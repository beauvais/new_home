The good folks over at ZDNet.com have published a couple of posts from my blog. In a bid to increase the scope of their topics, ZDNet have created a blog called [Web 2.0 Exlporer](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/web2explorer), which is made up of guest bloggers' posts. In this blog, two articles of mine have been posted. Please feel free to go and have a look (though it might be boring reading it twice!)

How Smart Can a Link Be?

Web 2.0- Don't call it that!

Let me know what you think.
