I've blogged about Kiva before, and my impression of them and their work keeps growing. Instead of talking more about how great they are, and how they make a huge difference, I'd like to simply host a very short documentary-promotion video about them. If you'd like more information, obviously, you can go to [http://www.kiva.org](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/www.kiva.org). If you'd like my personal experience, please feel free to tweet me(@zbeauvais) or email me (zach at zachbeauvais.com).
