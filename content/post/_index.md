I've been writing for a long time, and this blog sprawls across stories, ideas, comment, and – occasionally – politics.

Older posts tend toward technology and semantics. They've gradually morphed into observations and bits of my own biography. There's also a smattering of coffee collected throughout.

Have a read – best enjoyed with good coffee.
