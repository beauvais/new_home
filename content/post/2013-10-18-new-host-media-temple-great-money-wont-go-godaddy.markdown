[Media Temple](http://mediatemple.net) (mt) have looked after this site's hosting superbly. They handled problems (all of which were down to user error) promptly and with a bit of extra care. Under almost all circumstances, I support companies who work hard for their customers' loyalty. But, they were bought by [GoDaddy](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/uk.godaddy.com).

GoDaddy has an impressive reputation for chauvinism, playing on stereotypes, and generally mocking people.

No, seriously:

and...

(video has since been deleted, but you can search YouTube for GoDaddy commercials to get the gist.)

I think you get the picture. In fact, sorry for the pictures. I feel dirty having them on my site, and I feel worse thinking that my hosting money would be supporting such a company.

More troublingly, GoDaddy played a [big role in supporting SOPA](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Protests_against_SOPA_and_PIPA). Yes, they backed down, and stopped their support... eventually. But that's a big mark against any company.

(mt) were quick to point out, on Twitter, that they've taken the acquisition seriously – that GoDaddy has reinvented itself. Maybe they have; maybe they will. But they're the same company, and they make me feel sick.

Their [FAQs](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/faqs-about-the-godaddy-acquisition) point out the reasons they went along, and say they'll stay an independent, autonomous company. I wish them the best, but no. Between casual chauvinism, mocking "nerds", and generally seeking profit above freedom – it was an easy decision to make.

Honestly, I didn't feel there was a decision to make except on finding a new host.

For now, I've moved my online property over to UK-based [TSOHost](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/www.tsohost.com), on the recommendation of quite a few twitter friends. They migrated my site and domain on the same day, and seem pretty clued up on support so far. I have a few remaining domain names with (mt), one of which – mentaldemocracy.com – I might sell. The rest, I'll either transfer over next week, or simply wind them up.
