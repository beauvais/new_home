](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/set-72157600951906566) This is a podcast I recorded for Talis' Nodalities series of talks. Because Facebook has recently made announcements about moving in a Semantic Web direction, I spoke with their Senior Open Programs Manager, [David Recordon](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/davidrecordon.com), about Facebook's perspectives on many of the technologies they're beginning to use. We ended up discussing Social Networking as a [graph](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Graph_(mathematics))â€”that is: a network of related things. We also spoke about the [Open Graph Protocol](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/opengraphprotocol.org) they've worked on and touched on privacy and walled gardens.

As you listen to the podcast, you can have a look at the source code for [my site](http://www.zachbeauvais.com). (Just don't run any validators on it and complain about what a poor developer I am: I already know ;) ). In the head, you'll notice a few lines of metadata that are discussed in the podcast:

[su_note note_color="#fef9c5"]<meta property="og:title" content="Blogging Perspective" /> <meta property="og:type" content="blog" /> <meta property="og:email" content="contact@zachbeauvais.com" /> <meta property="og:url" content="http://www.zachbeauvais.com" /> <meta property="og:description" content="Zach Beauvais' home on the web: his perspective, images and ideas." />[/su_note]

For more information, you can also read the Nodalities Magazine article I wrote about Facebook's announcements.

The [Open Graph Protocol page](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/opengraphprotocol.org) has information about the protocol itself. [Facebook's f8 developers'](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/f8) conference site also has links with more information for developers.

Many thanks to David Recordon for having this conversation with me for Nodalities, and to my employer Talis, who has made this podcast available under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/3) license.
