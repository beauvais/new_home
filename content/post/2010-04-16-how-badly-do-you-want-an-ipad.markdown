The iPad is something I'm more curious about than lustful for. I want to see how it works, how it feels to use and what difference it'll make to the way I do things.

I'll be interested to see how it does at conferences, for example. Whether the format of a tablet is a useful thing to have due to weight and room. 

Also, I want to see how media is rendered and if it really does change anything about the way I interact with content.

So, not hugely badly, but I'll be happy to try it out. I imagine it might grow on  me though.
