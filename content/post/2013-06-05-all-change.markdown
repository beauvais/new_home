All change…

For the past decade, my wife and I have been very busy, and constantly shifting. I emigrated, and started university. We were learning how to live together and be a couple, and survive Central London.

We did a lot of moving. University ended, jobs started. Jobs changed. Jobs ended. Minuscule flat in Kings Cross to run-down outskirts of Hatfield, to the friendly Herts village of Markyate, to the incredibly beautiful brace of houses in Ludlow. Then Northampton, then Yorkshire…

We both want to find a rhythm which works for us, and to have a place to feel is a base on which to begin adventures – to be less itinerant.

It seems that 2013 is not going to be that year.
