Got one of those tagging tasks from Facebook. This is the first one I've done, and I thought it was interesting; so I thought' I'd post it here. Feel free to do one of your own and ping back here:


<blockquote>To do this, go to “notes” under tabs on your profile page, paste these instructions in the body of the note, type your 25 random things, tag 25 people (in the right hand corner of the app) then click publish. You can also "save drafts" so you don't have to work on this all in one sitting25 Random Things About Me

Rules: Once you've been tagged, you are supposed to write a note with 25 random things, facts, habits, or goals about you. At the end, choose 25 people to be tagged. You have to tag the person who tagged you. If I tagged you, it's because I want to know more about you (no pressure, if you want to write one, write one, don't do it cos this thing tells you to!).</blockquote>





	  1. I was born in Ft. Collins, a university town in northern Colorado.
	  2. I dislike very few foods. indeed I can only think of one dish I would not eat.
	  3. I hate flying; in part because of fact 4, but for other reasons as well.
	  4. I am afraid of being in high places. Some call it an irrational fear, but I have yet to grow wings, so find it rational enough.
	  5. I was born with such light-coloured hair, it was virtually pink.
	  6. I have a tendency to over-explain, rather than letting my statements...
	  7. I am picky about the films I watch, and consequently, haven't seen many lately.
	  8. The key I most use is the backspace key, followed by the left-arrow for correcting thoughts as I type.
	  9. I don't really have a favourite colour.
	  10. I tend not to like yellow very much.
	  11. I prefer trains to cars, but very much enjoy driving.
	  12. I am distressed to the point of insensibility by some things; and this makes me feel older than I am. Currently, I am 56; and inexplicably of high military rank.
	  13. I am often accused of linguistic pedantry.
	  14. I tend to disagree. I think this is too easy a reaction to anyone who understands grammar.
	  15. I often misspell grammar.
	  16. I make my living by thinking about other ways of doing and saying things, then writing them down. In other words, I work with concepts, the abstract, and writing.
	  17. Inconsequential things bother and exercise me more than important things.
	  18. I very much like dogs.
	  19. I enjoy creating, both with words and with images.
	  20. I have sold a painting in a coffee house. I have, so far, a 100% success rate for my art.
	  21. I enjoy semantics. Meaning is important to me.
	  22. I love thinking about things, in abstracts. I love metaphorical explanations of the way we think.
	  23. I dislike playing most games, mostly—I think—because I don't see the point in winning an inconsequential game. This includes winning games. I simply do not experience much joy in winning on arbitrary terms.
	  24. I don't understand why women need to know so many details about certain topics: child birth, for example.
	  25. My middle name is only an initial. It doesn't stand for anything at all.
