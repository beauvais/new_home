I just watched the most unhelpful but beautifully-shot promotional video for the new [Sony Ericsson XPERIA.](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/default.aspx?cc=GB&lc=en&lc=en&cc=US) I assume it's a mobile phone from the five-second glimpse you get of it. The rest of the video is a bit of a mystery. It's very enjoyable to watch, so I'd recommend it. It's got lots of paper aeroplanes flying around NYC, with a Mystery Tour song going round. 



In seriousness, I read a review on Last 100 about it, but they were baffled by the marketing speak too...



<blockquote>  The EXPERIA X1, available in the second half of 2008, is a "premium experience of energized communication", whatever that means.

It looks fun, and I can't wait to see what it will do; but I can't say I don't feel a bit sad that it's Windows Mobile. The limited experience I've had with WinMobiles has been poor, really. I don't really want my mobile phone to pause and hang like my PC does... However, I love Sony's hardware, and this looks rather fun...
