A couple weeks back, I spoke at a client conference for [Zengenti](http://zengenti.com) (where I work). We split the day into two broad streams – one focused on developers and sysadmins, and the other for "content."

It's been interesting working for a CMS vendor, and I like the fact that they properly focus on the content side of content management systems. This talk was fun, though watching it makes me cringe terribly.

I spoke about content governance – the who side of content strategy. I also wanted people to start thinking about editorial workflows, and learn from newspapers.
