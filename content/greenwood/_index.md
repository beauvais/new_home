I make useful things from trees.
I start every one of my projects with a tree. If I'm lucky, I get to fell it, but sometimes, I collect up a fresh log. I split green logs with a froe, axe, and wedges. The resulting planks (called billets) then face a carving axe for rough shaping.

Once the shape is roughed out, I move on to refining with straight blades and hook knives (which let me hollow out bowls).
