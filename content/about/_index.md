I am Zach Beauvais – a writer and content strategist who likes to help people tell their stories. I've worked mostly for web builders – software companies, and startups.

I've worn many job titles on name badges, from community manager to content strategist. I've tended to work with words and people, and keep my eye on big ideas.

I make and sell hand-carved, useful things (like spoons) from green wood for the Etsy shop [Wood from Trees][etsy].
