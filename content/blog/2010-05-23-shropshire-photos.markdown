For the past few months, I've been a member of the [Shropshire Community flickr group](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/shropshire_community), where a bunch of friendly photo-folk share pics and tips via the excellent networking features on flickr. Saturday, I was privileged to join them for the first time in person as twenty or so of us took a photo-romp around the Long Mynd and Church Stretton.

Below are a few of the photos I took on the day, and I apologise in advance for the number of buttercups: the sun was just so bright they lit right up.
