I have subscribed to Tim Ferriss' blog for a few weeks, and have found its content enlightening and interesting. Having done a degree in applied linguistics, I found the his item about [learning a language in an hour](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/how-to-learn-but-not-master-any-language-in-1-hour-plus-a-favor) interesting, if slightly mis-named.

Tim reckons that you can work out how to learn a language in about an hour, but not actually become fluent in it in that time. He lays out a plan for analysing and comparing differences between languages we might already know with a target language, and using that information to make decisions about how to learn.

As part of my studies at Kings, we looked at learning styles and communicative competencies. (Check out [George Yule](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1) for more on linguistics). I would have thought that the idea that you can focus on a particular tactic for learning a language lies partly with the language itself (and for that, Tim's blog entry seems completely apt), but also on identifying one's own learning styles and techniques. Then, a language could be tackled in a way which makes use of one's particular strengths while focusing on the areas which would most help.

I recommend Tim's blog, and think it's well worth a few hours reading!
