Here are a few shots taken from around the place I grew up in Colorado. It's been a long time since I lived here, but I have never forgotten just how arid and stark it can be. There is a beauty here, but it's a harsh, unrelenting beauty. The plants are tortured and frail or designed to torture others. As are the animals. Behind everything is the backdrop of the mountains, from where our hope comes (here, in the form of water).

I hope you enjoy.
