I'm afraid my old site decided it didn't like me any more and broke. I was in the process of updating the theme when my broadband connection dropped. I have no idea which file/s were corrupted, but I decided to simplify the blog.

 

This is not the theme it will remain, it's boring and narrow. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to leave comments (I'm working on a contact form!)

 

Thanks and sorry for any inconvenience: I assure you, it was worse for me ;)
