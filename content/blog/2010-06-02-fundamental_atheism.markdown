_This is based on a post which appeared on formspring.me/zbeauvais_
I think the instinct—for lack of a better word—that draws people to act religiously can also affect people with no official religion. While there may be no organised creed, there is organisation in a sort of tribal way. This may be in some way related to a culture of the [tribe](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Tribe). It's the same thing that allows me to identify the tribes of midwestern Christians from America by their handshake, clothing, and sociolect. It's the instinct that makes people buy into a group mentality like Apple fanboys, football supporters, and wine snobs.

I believe there to be a [culture](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/New_atheism) developing around [Dawkins](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Richard_Dawkins) and [Hitchens](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Christopher_Hitchens) and others. There are events like Godless and books like _[An Atheist's guide to Christmas](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1275774092&sr=8-1)_ which are somewhat organising, I suppose. Also, given the list of people who have contributed (among whom are many people I admire) I would be surprised if they don't make compelling, interesting and probably very funny reading. But I think the compelling and funny part of the atheist culture is not part of being fundamentally against others' beliefs, or against God or "a god". I think the idea of "[antitheism](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Antitheism)" is a far less compelling mindset. I don't like the idea that one sets their belief and rhetoric as an antithesis.

A possibly relevant illustration would be to look at this in terms of other antithesis positions, like political rhetoric based entirely on the principle of "not being them." It makes your position one relative to the existence, status, and nature of your opposition, which I think is at least silly and at most dangerous. If I were to consider myself to be an "antiTory," then I am simply diametrically opposed to the ideas of a party over which I have forfeited any constructive influence. What then for instance, if they do something I agree with? Being convinced for yourself that there is no god is different from setting yourself against the whole notion as the basis of your beliefs.

I don't think all people who disbelieve in God are "fundamentalist atheists." I don't equate a person's belief and perspective with religiosity. What I do think is that people can religiously follow a group or concept. The word fundamentalist itself is difficult to work with. It's something that is understood to be positive by people I wouldn't always think of as fundamentally fundamentalist themselves. For some, the idea of being fundamental is to be true to an idea, and this is not a bad thing in itself. I can fundamentally believe it is best to to act selflessly, to edify others, and this would clearly not be negative.

But I think the word has been used commonly to refer to a kind of self-subsumation into the tribe, culture and ideology of a group. News reports of "fundamentalist terrorists," which is probably unhelpful, but the word seems to convey a meaning that is useful sometimes, when talking about individuals who surrender their own perspectives to the tribe.

So, in a similar way to how I think of fundamentalist religious people, I would probably consider a "fundamentalist atheist" to be one who believes strongly that there is no god. One who believes that he is in a superior position for believing this way, and that those who believe otherwise are in some sense inferior (pagan, heathen, barbaric perhaps?). And, it would be a person for whom atheism fills a sociological need to belong to a tribe more than it fills the answer to a personal question about the meaning(s) of life.

I fully understand the desire to break free from religious thinking and teaching, and the need to feel unconstrained by a tribal group. I also understand the social desire to feel looked after, cherished and loved and affirmed by being part of something bigger than myself. These tensions are difficult to balance, and I think people find their own ways to do so. I think the balance shifting uncontrollably toward seeking the approval or support of a social group organised around a set of ideas (teaching, creed, reasoning, books and the rest) can only lead to a loss of one's own, unique perspective. It's a loss to the world.
