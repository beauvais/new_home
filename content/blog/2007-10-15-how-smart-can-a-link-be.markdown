In a bid to test a bit of the Semantic Web, I have inserted a little line of Java script into my blog which should automatically turn many of my links [Smart](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/?p=674). Not 8 hours after I had inserted the script, I was contacted by Fraser at AdaptiveBlue, the creaters of the Smartlink technology, who asked how I was finding the new links. After offering me some advice about 'Turning on Smartlinks in my Blog', Fraser also agreed to a Question and Answer post about AdaptiveBlue (watch this space...)

Because I have been trialling BlueOrganiser for a few weeks, I am somewhat familiar with the technology, and do find it useful. I have not, however, noticed any of my links becoming 'Smart' of their own accord. I did manage to manually make a couple of links smart by adding a bit of HTML to the blog article (<smartlink="yes") which enabled AdaptiveBlue's flashy menu with information on Apple and the iPhone. However, the automatic tech doesn't seem to have worked with my Drupal website (after inserting the code in the page.tpl.php file--just like Google Analytics' Urchin code). Fraser suggested I create the following [link](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/103-2083853-2928631?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1193101114&sr=8-1), to test out the smartness of my placement.

Is it Smart?

It does indeed appear to be Smart but is displaying the following error message:

"Rats! The Smart isn't connecting to this Link..."

Oh well, it's a step in the right direction for the Semantic Web. More on this later!
