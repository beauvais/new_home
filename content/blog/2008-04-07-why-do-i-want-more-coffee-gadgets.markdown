Gizmodo is a techblog with loads of interesting products. They have a complete set of [Coffee-tagged products](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/coffee), all of which I want to own.

I have no idea why, but I've got this thing for coffee gadgets. Every part of the kit appeals to me.




  * I love coffee
  * They're gadgets
  * They involve an addictive process (like setting up a blogging engine)
  * It's a type of [lifehack](http://www.lifehacker.com/)
  * There's a considerable risk (you might get burned, or it might explode)

So, if you have any coffee gadgets you'd like to tell me about, please let me know!!!



P.S. this is my first post ever using BlogJetâ€¦ It'll probably also be my last, since it's virtually the same as Windows Live Writer, but costs--and isn't as pretty.
