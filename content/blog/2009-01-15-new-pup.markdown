](http://www.zachbeauvais.com/flickr/photo/3201424340/lucas.html)I just picked up an 8-week old pup. He's a black lab/plummer terrier cross. I'm thinking of calling him Lucas. Both of his parents are steady and bidable workers: the sire being used for picking up, the dam for ratting.
He's met the kitteh, and didn't move too much when she tapped him on the nose, so I'm hoping he'll be steady!
I'll find the camera in a bit and put up some flickr links here at some point. We ordered a crate big enough for a full-grown lab, and I'm thinking that may have been a mistake... He's tiny!
Right, I'm desperate for a cuppa...
