Last week, I wrote about Nick Carr's new book on ZDNet's [Web 2.0 Explorer](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/web2explorer) blog.

I got home last night to find a note from the Post Office confirming that the anticipated Amazon parcel had arrived. Also waiting for me were three editions of the _[Financial Times](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/www.ft.com)_, this month's _Wired_ and this month's _Harvard Business Review_.

I'm still reading last month's HBR! :-( And I need to reread [Weaving the Web](http://zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/0062515861%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002) before next week. Hmm... clearly time to stop sleeping or something.
