I have some news. I will be leaving the lovely team at [Fluent](http://this.isfluent.com), where I have been their in-house content strategist for over a year. I have accepted a very tempting offer from a company called [Zengenti](http://zengenti.com).

Zengenti produces an enterprise-sized content management system (CMS), which powers big websites â€“ such as Kings College London (my alma mater). My new title will be Head of Content and Communities, and the job description is quite wide. I'll be working with pretty much every team, and helping clients to organise their content (which is, after all, what websites are for), and make the most of their websites. I'll also be helping Zengenti to build up and support their community of users and partner companies.

Zengenti is based in Ludlow, and I'll be working there two days each week, and remotely the rest. They have a good team, and I know a few folk already through an event I started years back called [Shropgeek](http://www.shropgeek.co.uk/).

I am looking forward to spending time in my favourite place on earth, and equally having more time here in our new (and first) home.
