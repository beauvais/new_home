This is the source code for a new home for zachbeauvais.com. It's a long way from going live.

It uses [Hugo][] as a static site generator.

It uses a theme called wood_theme, which is built from a customised set of SASS files from the [Bulma][] CSS framework.

I used some quick and clever scripts from a blog post by [Markus Oberlehner][Markus] to use npm and Gulp to build and watch the repository.

This is an early draft.
